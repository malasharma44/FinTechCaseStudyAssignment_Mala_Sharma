## Business Activities:
* Initially, the company was meant to create a more secure shopping experience, however early controversy in the foundational years didn't prove the company to be reliable.

consumer need for post-delivery split payments on merchandise.
* The company's intended customer involves both various retail entities as well as consumers with access to internet and or smartphone devices across the. Since 2015, Klarna has made the US market their target audience even going so far as to have a 2021 Super Bowl advertisement featuring Maya Rudolph. Klarna has also expanded their financial services in Germany since 2021 with exclusive access to bank account services via IBAN & Visa. Simultaneously Klarna's "unfair advantage" involves the fact that they only perform a soft credit check for customers that would like to use their "four payment" service. Additionally, across global markets, tech has moved exponentially faster than goverment oversight of the online banking sectors and their myriad subsectors. As of 2017, Klarna Group was active on 18 markets with 45 million consumers and 65,000 merchants Today, Klarna Group is active on 18 markets, and has more than 1400 employees. It

## Landscape

* Over the past 5-10 years innovators and disruptors such as Paypal, Square, Shopify, & Afterpay etc. have changed the terms of  online payment operations in ways that have caused controversy globally with new measures being taken for more government regulations for this niche sector of the financial market.
## Results
* Especially with the rise of emotional spending, increased online presence globally, and highly efficient behavioral markets, the post-pandemic prospects indicate Klarna's success. The 2021 Super Bowl advertisement has most likely increased Klarna's reach in the United States with new users joining at consistently high rates throughout the pandemic and with new merchants joining the platform's exclusive rewards partnerships.
* Within the existing marketplace, Klarna is judged based on the global reach straddling existing banking and credit industries and new user app downloads & transaction rates. Among competitors , Klarna is meeting the ranks of Afterpay in the USA and through global shareholders, Klarna is gaining trust amongst users.
* Klarna should perhaps work to continue merging with other innovators in FinTech and more conventional financial service providers.
